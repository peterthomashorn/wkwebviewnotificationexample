# WKWebView Notification Example

This project serves as an example on how to pass web notifications through as native notifications on macOS. I created it as part of [my answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58615934/769502) to [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48672361/769502) on how to capture notifications in a `WKWebView`.

The code quality and documentation is in class of a proof-of-work, not (yet) educational. 

This project was created with Xcode 11.1 on macOS 10.15 Catalina.
